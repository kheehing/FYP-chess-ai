# Chess AI Final Year Project (FYP)

## Overview
This project focuses on developing a Chess AI using Deep Q-Network (DQN) techniques and reinforcement learning. The AI learns from historical games and simulations, and it integrates with chess engines like Stockfish for validation.

## Features
- **Data Ingestion:** Load and preprocess chess datasets.
- **Model Training:** Train the AI using reinforcement learning.
- **Game Simulation:** Simulate games with the trained AI.
- **Chess Engine Integration:** Validate moves with Stockfish.
- **Evaluation:** Measure performance with metrics like Elo rating.
